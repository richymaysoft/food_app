# food_app
A simple food app frontend development for the purpose showcasing my flutter skill. It contains a lot of dynamic functionalities, use of third party packages, Riverpod state management package, simple signUp/login function, simple favorite features, add to cart, use of dummy data to act as a simple data source, conditional rendering of UI..  etc.
